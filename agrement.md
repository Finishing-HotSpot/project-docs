 # Group Project: Team Agreement

### Fishing Hotspot Team Agreement

The first step in project planning is establishing a Team Agreement. This will be used as the guideline for how your team will collaborate during project week.  Our team agreement is everyone will be present and ready to contribute to the project when meetings are scheduled, respectful and professional.
 
Projects are stressful and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn’t be a problem. It’s important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.
 
### Planning

Schedule a 1-hour meeting for your entire project team.
 
Use this time to review the Team Agreement requirements below and establish consensus on how to handle each requirement.
 
###  Deliverable
Start a public-facing GitHub markdown file and include the following components in your team agreement submission.
 
###  Cooperation Plan
Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.
 
Our team will be willing to cooperate and share ideas and help each other achieve the project task and goals.
 
###  Describe at least:
 
What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
Justin Agim strength is he is critical thinker and ask probing questions for clarification.


Ajamu Page strength is he is excellent with debugging code and writing difficult JavaScript code. He is also a great teacher and mentor for the team.

Brian Kimbrow is a great leader and has lots of experience with web design and development project experience.

Andrea Malone is a hard worker and willing to learn and lean in to achieve greater understanding of software development.

How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

We will use these strengths by delegating work to the team members who excel in the areas needed to complete the task.
In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

Andrea would like to develop greater strength in code git hub repository.

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.
 
### Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.
 
Describe at least:
 
What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

### Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.
The communication Plan we will use will be text through slack, Phone calls, & emails.
 
Describe at least:
 
What hours will you be available to communicate? We are available to communicate when needed.
What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?  We will communicate via phone, slack, and email.

How often will you take breaks? Breaks will be as needed.  It is hard to determine breaks. It will depend on the hour and how far along we are on our work.

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?  If we fall behind, we will spend longer and extra hours catching up the work prior to the project deadlines.

How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend? We will communicate by phone, slack, and emails.
What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?  We will ask if anyone has additional questions or things they need clarified prior to moving on to each task.

How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?  It is very hard to determine that.  We must make sure that we all input and being open minded to all suggestions that are put forth.

### Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” effort.
Our work plan will consist of everyone checking in via slack and sharing their work in Google Doc. The use of the Trello app and Git hub will also aid in tracking everyone is contributing equally.
 
NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.
 
Describe at least:
 
How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
What project management tool will be used?  The tool we will use is Trello.

### Presentation Deck
Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.
 
Link to the shared doc in your project plan.
 
### Schedule your practice session
Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.
We will schedule time with are instructor when we are at the point to present our project.
Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:
 
Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”

### Git Process
Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.
 
Describe at least:
 
What components of your project will live on GitHub? The majority of our coding work will be on GitHub.

How will you share the repository with your teammates? The repository will be shared by branching pulling and merging.
What is your Git flow?

Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
How many people must review a PR?

Who merges PRs? The team leader will merge the PR.
How often will you merge? A merge will take place a each step work is complete.

How will you communicate that it’s time to merge? A text or email will be sent out to the team

### Submitting Your Work
This is a group submission. Only one person must submit for group credit.
 
Please have everyone’s name at the top of the doc.
 
Submit a link to your GitHub markdown file where you have created your Team Agreement. Done
 
This step must be completed and approved before proceeding with any project work. Notify your instructor when this is ready for review. Done
